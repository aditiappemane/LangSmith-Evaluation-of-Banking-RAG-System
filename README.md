# RAG Implementation for Banking Knowledge Base using LangChain

A bank needs an AI assistant to answer questions about loan products, regulatory requirements, and internal policies using a knowledge base of documents. This solution must use the LangChain framework to leverage its document processing, vector storage, and chain orchestration capabilities.

## Document Types in Knowledge Base
The system will process various banking documents, including:
- **Loan handbooks** with complex amortization tables
- **Regulatory manuals** with multi-page compliance matrices
- **Policy documents** mixing narrative text with structured tables
- **Rate sheets** with interconnected pricing tables

## Technical Requirements
Framework: Must use LangChain for:
- Document loading and preprocessing
- Text splitting and chunking strategies
- Vector embeddings and storage
- Retrieval chain implementation
- Prompt engineering and LLM integration

## Key RAG Challenges to Solve
- **Table Context Loss:** Chunking breaks relationships between table headers and data rows
- **Cross-Reference Failures:** "See Table 3.2" references become meaningless after chunking
- **Inconsistent Responses:** Same question yields different answers due to fragmented table data
- **Compliance Risk:** Incorrect loan terms or rates could violate banking regulations

## LangChain Components to Utilize
Your implementation should demonstrate proficiency with:
- Document Loaders (UnstructuredFileLoader, PyPDFLoader, etc.)
- Text Splitters (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, custom splitters)
- Vector Stores (Chroma, FAISS, or Pinecone)
- Embeddings (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or similar)
- Retrieval Chains (RetrievalQA, ConversationalRetrievalChain)
- Memory for conversation context
- Custom Chains for specialized banking workflows

## Cost Optimization Considerations
Important: Enterprise RAG implementations can be expensive. Create a supplementary document titled "Cost-Effective RAG Implementation Guide" that analyzes:

## High-Cost Components to Optimize:
- **Premium LLM APIs** (GPT-4, Claude) â€“ Primary cost driver
- **Vector database hosting** (Pinecone, Weaviate cloud)
- **Document processing APIs** (Unstructured, Azure Document Intelligence)
- **Compute resources for embedding generation**
